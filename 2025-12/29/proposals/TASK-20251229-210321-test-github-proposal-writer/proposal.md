# GitHub Integration Test - Proposal

## Purpose

Validate and verify the GitHub push integration for the Discord dispatch system. This test confirms that proposals generated through Discord can be automatically committed and pushed to your GitHub repository.

## Scope & Deliverables

- **Integration validation** - Confirm Discord → Worker → GitHub flow executes without errors
- **Push verification** - Validate that proposal content appears correctly in target repository
- **Documentation update** - Record test results and any configuration adjustments needed
- **Handoff** - Working integration ready for production proposal generation

## What Changes When This Goes Live

You'll know the system works end-to-end. Every proposal generated through Discord will automatically version-control itself in GitHub, creating an audit trail and backup system that runs without you touching it.

## Timeline

**Week 1**
- Execute test push (Day 1)
- Verify repository update (Day 1)
- Document results (Day 2)
- System ready for production use (Day 3)

## Investment

**Total: $500**

- 50% ($250) - Upon approval
- 50% ($250) - Upon successful test completion

This is a flat-fee engagement. The price covers the test execution, verification, and documentation regardless of hours spent.
