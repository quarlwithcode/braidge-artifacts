# Level 4 Agentic AI Stack Presentation

## Slide Deck: Autonomous Skilled Workers

---

### Overview

This presentation introduces the Level 4 Agentic AI Stack—a framework for building autonomous skilled workers that operate independently, make decisions, and execute complex multi-step tasks without human intervention.

**Design Approach:**
- 2026 minimal typography with generous whitespace
- Dark theme (#0A0E27 deep navy) with high-contrast text
- Soft atmospheric gradients (deep purple to navy)
- Big, bold headlines (72-96pt)
- Maximum 6 lines of body text per slide
- 16:9 widescreen format

### Slide 3: The Stack Architecture

**Layout:** Dark background with centered content

**Headline (72pt, bold, white):** The Stack Architecture

**Body (32pt, light gray):**
- **Controller Layer** → Routes tasks to specialized workers

**Column 2: Consistency**
- Same quality every time
- Brand standards enforced
- No human variability

**Column 3: Scale**
- Handle unlimited tasks
- Parallel processing
- Zero marginal cost

**Visual Element:**
- Each column has a subtle rounded container (dark purple #1F1347)
- Top border accent (gradient blue)
